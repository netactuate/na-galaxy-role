NetActuate Compute Node
=========

This repository contains the netactuate_compute_node module.  The netactuate_compute_node module allows for automation of provisioning, de-provisioning, startup and shutdown tasks of compute nodes.

Requirements
------------

  * Ansible == 2.4.3
  * libcloud == 2.3.0

Installation
------------

First, you should install libcloud if it is not already installed.  This can be done as follows.

For RedHat derivative (note package name may be distribution version dependent):

    yum install python36-libcloud

For Debian derivative:

    apt install libcloud

Finally:

    ansible-galaxy install netactuate.netactuate-compute-node


Variables
---------

List of required Role or Host variables

	state
		Desired state. One of [ present, running, stopped, terminated ]
	location
		Install location. ID or full name of location from portal.
	operating_system
		Install OS. ID or full name of OS from portal.
	ssh_public_key
		Path to your public key file.
	mbpkgid
		Package ID of purchased package to work with.  Optional.  If mbpkgid is not specified for an existing node, it will
		be resolved by the hostname parameter if the unique parameter is true and there is exactly one non-terminated node with
		that hostname.  mbpkgid will not yet be assigned for a new node and is not expected.
	hostname
		FQDN to set for the node.
	unique
		Indicates that the hostname is unique and can be used as a node identifier.  If an attempt is made to build a
		node with a duplicate hostname while unique=true, an error will be returned.
	auth_token
		API key from settings page on portal.
		This can also be set in the environment variable HOSTVIRTUAL_API_KEY.
		If both are set, the module parameter takes precedence over the environment variable.
	package_billing
		Desired package billing.  Absent for standard subscription billing, otherwise 'contract' to associate with a contract service or 'usage' for usage billing.
	contract_id
		Optional for standard or usage billing, required for contract billing.  The contract ID to associate the node with.


Dependencies
------------

This module does not depend on any other roles, it is the base role to ensure
your OS is installed and running.

Examples
----------------

Both examples assume an inventory.txt containing the following:

    [master]
    localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=python

This is the minimum you need in a playbook to ensure running state for the specified node.

    ---
    - hosts: master
      connection: local

      tasks:
      - name: Ensure na_compute_node is running
        na_compute_node:
          auth_token: <api key from portal>
          hostname: <node hostname>
          ssh_public_key: <ssh public key content>
          operating_system: <image name or ID from portal>
          location: <location name or ID from portal>
          plan: <plan name from portal>
          state: running
          unique: true
        delegate_to: localhost

This is a a more complete example exhibiting dynamic inventory enrollment.
